## Project Description

This project aims to explain the concept and methods of Time Series Analysis. It provides guidance for those who want to understand and analyze different time series data.

## Used technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn libraries
- Time Series Analysis Algorithms

## Setup

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/UserName/TimeSeriesAnalysis.git`
2. Go to the project directory: `cd TimeSeriesAnalysis`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Use

1. Download the project files and install the required packages as needed.
2. Examine time series analysis methods and examples.
3. Follow data preparation steps and model training.

## What is Time Series Analysis?

Time Series Analysis is a statistical method that examines the change of data measured at certain intervals over time. This analysis is used to predict future values and understand trends.

## Data Preparation

1. Loading or creating time series data.(Coco Dataset)
2. Implement data preprocessing steps (missing values, outliers, etc.).
3. Visualizing and analyzing time series data.

## Model Training

1. Model training using Time Series Analysis methods.
2. Setting and validating model parameters.

## Results and Evaluation

Details on the results of the project and how the Time Series Analysis methods can be used will be included here.
